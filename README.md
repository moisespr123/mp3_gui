# mp3_gui
A GUI to encode music files to MP3

![v1.0 Screenshot](https://moisescardona.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP3-GUI-v1.0.png)

You need ffmpeg copied to the location where you have this software or added to the system PATH variable.

Ffmpeg needs to be compiled with support for either libshine or libmp3lame. Both are preferred to enable both GUI encoder options.
